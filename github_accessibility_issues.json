Color tokens and theme - Help define a scalable color system and light/dark themes\r\n2. Sidebar experience - Improve navigation and information hierarchy\r\n3. Typography - Define type scale, fonts, and typographic styles\r\n4. Collection DX - Enhance dx for managing collections of APIs\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity for designers interested in open source to directly influence a popular dev tool. We welcome any and all design contributions - from user research findings to high-fidelity mockups and Figma to front-end code. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in helping out, please comment on this issue or reach out to [@firecampdev](https://twitter.com/firecampdev) We'd love to work with you!\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any other questions. Excited to collaborate with the design community to improve firecamp!",

Add a button or toggle so that users can switch from the current design (dark mode) to a new design (light mode). \r\n\r\n- For the light mode design only utilize colors that already exist on the EmojiScreen website. \r\n- For the toggle or button, if you would like to use an icon use Font Awesome or an emoji. \r\n- Add the toggle/button in the header area (see example of area below).\r\n- The button should be accessible and should be able to be operated using the keyboard.\r\n- Keep in mind color contrast for accessibility.\r\n- Keep in mind, that you can't always just convert what is currently white to black or vice versa to create a light-mode version of this site. For example, some of the emoji cards have black emojis so turning the white background will make them too hard to see. You will need to be creative in how you update the colors.\r\n- If needed more design guidance can be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1401\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 9 44 08 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/assets/23530405/82a84855-4c0a-4b73-9a09-6132d900083c\">\r\n",

To enhance accessibility and ease of use, there is a need to implement a graphical user interface (GUI).\r\n\r\n## Objectives\r\n\r\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a simple and intuitive GUI that allows users to easily select input and output directories, and view a list of supported image formats.\r\n\r\n- **Image Preview:** Implement functionality to preview images before and after the \r\nX-ray effect is applied.\r\n\r\n- **Batch Processing:** Enable users to select and process multiple images simultaneously through the GUI.\r\n\r\n- **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages in the GUI, especially for common issues like file format incompatibility or read/write permissions.\r\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the GUI is compatible with different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- The GUI should be developed using a Python-compatible framework, such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.\r\n\r\n- The design should be clean and minimalistic, focusing on functionality and ease of use.\r\n\r\n- Integration with the existing logic of the application must be seamless and efficient.\r\n\r\n## Potential Challenges\r\n\r\n- Ensuring that the GUI is responsive and can handle large batches of images without significant performance drops.\r\n\r\n- Maintaining the simplicity of the interface while providing all necessary functionalities.",

To enhance the website's functionality and provide a more comprehensive experience, we propose implementing a footer that includes essential elements such as copyright information, contact details, and links to relevant pages.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of adding a footer:\r\n\r\n* **Improved user experience:** A well-designed footer can enhance the user experience by providing easy access to essential information and navigation options.\r\n\r\n* **Enhanced website credibility:** A footer with copyright information and contact details can instill trust and credibility in the website.\r\n\r\n* **Consistent branding:** A footer can maintain brand consistency by incorporating brand elements such as logos, color schemes, and typography.\r\n\r\n### Tasks:\r\n\r\n1. Design the footer layout: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly footer layout that aligns with the overall website design.\r\n\r\n2. Implement footer elements: Include essential elements in the footer, such as:\r\n    * Copyright information: Clearly state the website's copyright year and ownership.\r\n    * Contact details: Provide contact information, such as email address and contact form, for users to reach out to website administrators.\r\n    * Links to relevant pages: Include links to important pages, such as the privacy policy, terms of service, and about us page.\r\n\r\n3. Integrate footer into the website: Seamlessly integrate the designed footer into the website's existing layout, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices.\r\n\r\n4. Test and refine: Thoroughly test the footer implementation to ensure it functions correctly and enhances the user experience. Make necessary adjustments based on testing results.",

Avoid making changes to the way the `stores/userCV.ts` operates unless nessescary.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility and Usability\r\n- No specific accessibility or usability standards identified at this stage, but open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Request for Implementation\r\nWe seek a comprehensive implementation of these enhancements in a single development phase. This feature aims to significantly improve user interaction with our CV upload module, making it more intuitive and efficient. \r\n\r\n## Target File for Modification\r\n- The primary file that needs the most modification is `tabs/uploadCV.svelte`.",

When the a11y addon panel has a scrollbar it overlays the highlight checkboxes which prevents you from clicking on a highlight checkbox.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/assets/31220528/7142f841-9a82-4dbe-b680-493e3fd77337)\r\n\r\n2. I also have the same issue with the \"Tests completed\" text that overlays the text and highlight checkbox of the last result when the panel is docked to the right:\r\n![image](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/assets/31220528/2e0acc45-5589-47a8-b61e-0a6f31c7445c)\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the a11y's Accessibility panel\r\n2. Lower the panel height to make it vertically scrollable\r\n3. Hover your mouse over a highlight checkbox\r\n4. A scrollbar appears which prevents you from clicking on the highlight checkbox\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n`npx storybook@latest info` hung after displaying the text \"Storybook Environment Info:\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nIt seems to be caused by the `min-width` css property on the `::before` element of the scrollbar. (And I think the `min-height` on the `::before` causes similar issues.)\r\n\r\nThe second issue can possibly be resolved by adding a padding-bottom to the scrollable content to acommodate for the \"Tests completed\" text.",

It needs context.\n    - [ ] Each section of the documentation lacks any \u201cwhy\u201d regarding the need for or use of the particular section.\n    - [ ] Without context, it makes the information less approachable.\n\n3. It needs conceptualization.\n    - [ ] Each section lacks context for either Flutter or game development.\n    - [ ] This could include references to Flutter via link or explanation as well as those for common game development concepts.\n\n4. It needs to be more atomic.\n    - [ ] Some pages should be sections (especially Components and Effects).\n    - [ ] These sections, when broken up, would be easier to find.\n\n5. It has links that need correction.\n    - [x] Some, like those at the bottom of Collision Detection, need to be fixed.\n\n6.

        "body": "To improve the clarity and accessibility of the Finesse Backend's API, we are introducing Swagger documentation. This will offer a structured and interactive interface for our API, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with our system.\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] Investigate how to best integrate Swagger with finesse-backend.\r\n- [ ] Install Swagger-related dependencies.\r\n- [ ] Configure Swagger to document existing Flask routes.\r\n- [ ] Verify that the Swagger UI is properly displaying and interacting with our API endpoints.\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n1. Swagger UI displays and operates as expected.\r\n2. All endpoints are accurately documented.\r\n## Architectural Design Options:\r\nThere are multiple ways to create Swagger documentation with the `flask` library, each with its own considerations and trade-offs.\r\n### flask_swagger_ui :\r\n---\r\n**Description:**\r\n`flask_swagger_ui` is a library that generates Swagger documentation for Flask applications. It relies on a static OpenAPI specification (json) file to display API documentation.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n- **Straightforward setup:** Setting up `flask_swagger_ui` is relatively simple, as it only requires pointing to a static OpenAPI specification file.\r\n- **Non-intrusive:** The code does not need to be modified, only need to add the new part\r\n- **Editor online:** Swagger provides an online editor to simplify the creation of the json file\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n- **Static documentation:** The documentation is static and may not automatically update with changes in the code, leading to potential synchronization issues.\r\n- **Manual updates:** Any modifications to the API require manual updates to the json file, increasing the risk of errors, inconsistencies and time consumption.\r\n- **Limited community support:** The community support might be limited compared to more widely adopted alternatives.\r\n\r\n### flask_restplus :\r\n---\r\n**Description:**\r\n`flask_restplus` is an extension for Flask that builds on top of `flask_restful` to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs. It includes built-in Swagger support and additional features for API documentation.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n- **Integrated Swagger support:** `flask_restplus` provides built-in Swagger support, making it easier to generate and maintain API documentation.\r\n- **Dynamic documentation:** Swagger documentation is generated dynamically from the code, ensuring that the documentation stays in sync with the API implementation.\r\n- **Namespace and resource support:** It introduces the concepts of namespaces and resources, aiding in the organization and modularization of API code.\r\n- **Potential time savings:** The dynamic nature of documentation generation in flask_restplus can potentially save time\r\n- **Active community support:** Being a popular choice, `flask_restplus` benefits from an active and supportive community.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n- **Intrusive code:** Requires to modify the current structure with namespaces and resources\r\n- **Less dynamic documentation:** While it generates Swagger documentation, it might be less dynamic and often requires additional annotations to provide comprehensive details.\r\n\r\n### flask_restx :\r\n---\r\n**Description:**\r\n`flask_restx` is an extension of `flask_restful` that adds support for Swagger generation. While keeping the same advantages than `flask_restplus`, it introduces better documentation.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n- **Better dynamic documentation:** Provides a more dynamic Swagger documentation generated directly from the code, ensuring automatic synchronization with API changes.\r\n-  **Direct code annotations:** Allows for adding Swagger annotations directly in the code, simplifying documentation maintenance.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n- **Initial learning curve:** Transitioning from `flask_restplus` to `flask_restx` may involve some adaptation and a steeper initial learning curve. \r\n\r\nConsideration of these architectural design options will help in making an informed decision based on the specific requirements and preferences of the project.\r\n## Close PR:\r\n- closes #27",

It's in the Rails code, but all the tech details are already over there.\r\n\r\nThis deadlock happens because comment (and, much more rarely, story) creation is locking tables in a different order than vote creation (slash updating?). Maybe because of assigning the user's initial upvote or some memoized value like score/karma/votes/number of comments/etc.\r\n\r\nThe job here is to vote/unvote stories and comments in dev, and read the rails server log for the order that tables are touched in. Then same for story and comment posting. I am almost certain that will uncover tables accessed in a different order. Just posting those notes as a comment here would be very helpful!\r\n\r\nIf that is indeed the cause of the deadlock, then we have to shlep through the controllers and callbacks to figure out how to reorder, simplify, or break apart the transactions. Probably nothing even needs to be in a transaction, we're just getting it from Rails by default. But since I touched all the score code in 20c15907 I think voting should always work by doing `score += 1` or `score = sum(votes)` rather than an unsafe `select ... add 1 in ruby ... update`, so a transaction is unneeded.",

Considering the nature of the project and its focus on Hebrew language processing, providing a Hebrew version of the Terms of Service would be highly beneficial.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\nI propose the addition of a Hebrew translation of the Terms of Service. This would not only align with the linguistic focus of the project but also make the terms more accessible to native Hebrew speakers and those proficient in the language.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- **Language Alignment:** As \"ivrit.ai\" deals with Hebrew language processing, having its legal and usage terms in Hebrew is fitting and coherent.\r\n- **User Accessibility:** A Hebrew version will be more accessible and understandable for users who are native Hebrew speakers or more proficient in Hebrew than in English.\r\n- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Offering terms in the local language shows respect for the cultural and linguistic context of the project.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Considerations\r\n- Ensure accurate and legally sound translation of the English Terms of Service.\r\n- The translation should be reviewed by legal experts proficient in both English and Hebrew to maintain the integrity of the legal terms.\r\n\r\nI hope this addition will be considered, as it could greatly enhance the accessibility and user experience of \"ivrit.ai\" for Hebrew-speaking users.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request.\r\n",

The reason why setting a font-size of 16 pixels or larger on input fields prevents this zooming behavior lies in the way Safari handles mobile web pages.\r\n\r\nMobile Accessibility Features: On mobile devices, especially on smartphones, the screens are smaller, and the default text size can be challenging to read. To improve accessibility and readability, iOS Safari automatically zooms in on input fields if the text is below a certain threshold size. This is intended to help users see and interact with the input field more easily.\r\n\r\nDefault Minimum Font Size: The default threshold in iOS Safari for zooming on input fields is a font size of 16 pixels. This means that if the text in an input field is smaller than 16 pixels, Safari assumes it might be too small for comfortable interaction and automatically zooms in to make the text more legible.\r\n\r\nPreventing Zoom with Font Size: By explicitly setting the font size of input fields to 16 pixels or larger, you're effectively telling Safari that the text is already sufficiently large for easy interaction. This prevents the browser from applying its automatic zoom, as it recognizes that the text meets or exceeds the minimum legibility threshold.\r\n\r\nConsistency Across Browsers: While this behavior is specific to Safari on iOS, setting a reasonable font size for input fields is a good practice for web design in general. It ensures better consistency and usability across various browsers and devices.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, setting font-size: 16px on input fields is a simple and effective way to maintain a consistent and user-friendly layout on iOS devices, preventing the automatic zoom behavior of Safari and enhancing the overall user experience on mobile web pages.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWe probably want to have font size in inputs 16px by default. But I'm not 100% sure.",

        "body": "## Spectral Clustering of quantms Data and Spectral Library Generation\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nquantms, a cutting-edge workflow, has reanalyzed an extensive dataset of almost 1 billion MS/MS (Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry) scans, comprising nearly 100 million PSMs (Peptide-Spectrum Matches) derived from various tissues, cell lines, and diseases. In light of this vast wealth of data, our project aims to apply spectral clustering techniques to organize this data and construct spectral libraries. \r\n\r\n### Project Goals\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Development of an Incremental Clustering Algorithm**: The primary objective of this project is to design a novel algorithm for spectral clustering that leverages an incremental clustering approach. This approach will allow us to efficiently organize the vast volume of MS/MS data generated by quantms. The algorithm and workflow should be implemented in nextflow using the popular tool MaRACluster (see appendix). \r\n\r\n   - [x] #5 \r\n\r\n- [ ] **Creation of New Spectral Libraries**: We will generate updated spectral libraries based on the comprehensive quantms dataset. These libraries will serve as invaluable resources for researchers in the field of mass spectrometry, enabling them to identify peptides and their corresponding spectra.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Development of a Command-Line Search Tool**: A crucial component of our project is the creation of a command-line tool. This tool will enable users to search for specific peptide sequences or spectra within the spectral libraries using the innovative algorithm, as described in our previous publication [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391920304383]. This user-friendly tool will significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of the spectral libraries.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Application to Proteogenomics and PTMs**: Once we have successfully developed the algorithm and infrastructure, we will expand our scope to apply these tools to proteogenomics datasets and the analysis of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). This extension will provide researchers with a comprehensive platform for studying protein-related phenomena beyond traditional peptide identification.\r\n\r\n### Expected Impact\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this project will have significant implications for the field of mass spectrometry and proteomics. Researchers and scientists will benefit from more efficient data organization and advanced search capabilities, which will enhance their ability to extract meaningful insights from large-scale MS/MS datasets. Additionally, the development of spectral libraries and their application to proteogenomics and PTM analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe are excited to embark on this project to harness the power of spectral clustering and deep learning algorithms to revolutionize the analysis of MS/MS data. With your support, we can make significant strides in advancing the field of mass spectrometry and proteomics. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and bring our innovative approach to fruition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Appendix: \r\n\r\nBecause the amount of data and volume is too big, we aim to implement an incremental clustering strategy. Instead of using spark as previously, we can implement an interactive/incremental approach that for every cluster iteration we keep the most relevant/high quality PSMs by cluster, the number can be tested from 10 to 20. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bigbio/spectrafuse/assets/52113/24a7c9ac-7287-421c-b8f1-6319764ed29c)\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/bigbio/spectrafuse/blob/main/docs/algorithm.png\r\n\r\n\r\n### Workflow Notes \r\n\r\n**Tool mgf-converter**: We should take every project here and convert them into MGF files. Note: We need to think carefully here because some of the projects have more than 30 M PSMs, and we should not create one MGF file per project because it will be too big. I recommend here to use at the beginning a batch size effect, by default 1M spectra per MGF File. \r\n\r\nWe will be clustering together only spectra from the same Instrument, Species and charge state. Then probably would be good in this conversion to create the files based on those three metrics. \r\n\r\n**MAraCluster**: With the MGF files, you should run MAraCluster tool and perform clustering. Remember that every clustering run should only contain the MGFs for the spectra that are from the same Species, charge and Instrument. \r\n\r\nEven if we cluster together only spectra from the same species, charge and instrument we may find that for some combinations of those three variables we have hundreds of millions of spectra, which probably will make\r\n\r\nMaracluster is not to scale properly. If that is the case we may explore an incremental approach where we cluster for example 10M spectra, then we can select for that batch the spectra based on:\r\n\r\nFor clusters with more than 20 spectra, we selected the best 5 spectra with better signal-to-noise ratio + better ID score (qvalue); or we can just generate the for every cluster the consensus spectra and use that in the next iteration. The problem with this approach is that we need to be sure the quality of the cluster does not deteriorate over cluster iterations. \r\n\r\n**Library converter**: \r\n      - After all the clustering is done we should have a folder with the corresponding structure: \r\n        - Species Name \r\n             - Instrument Name \r\n                  Libraries1-charge2\r\n                  Library2-charge3\r\n \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "### Increasing access\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to make p5.js more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for non-English speakers, by replacing the text-based \"Loading\" message with a simple loading animation.\r\n\r\n### Which types of changes would be made?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (Add-on libraries or sketches will work differently even if their code stays the same.)\r\n- [ ] Systemic change (Many features or contributor workflows will be affected.)\r\n- [X] Overdue change (Modifications will be made that have been desirable for a long time.)\r\n- [ ] Unsure (The community can help to determine the type of change.)\r\n\r\n### Most appropriate sub-area of p5.js?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Accessibility\r\n- [ ] Color\r\n- [X] Core/Environment/Rendering\r\n- [ ] Data\r\n- [X] DOM\r\n- [ ] Events\r\n- [ ] Image\r\n- [ ] IO\r\n- [ ] Math\r\n- [ ] Typography\r\n- [ ] Utilities\r\n- [ ] WebGL\r\n- [ ] Build process\r\n- [ ] Unit testing\r\n- [X] Internationalization\r\n- [ ] Friendly errors\r\n- [ ] Other (specify if possible)\r\n\r\n### What's the problem?\r\n\r\nCurrently, p5.js displays a text-based \"Loading\" message in the top-left corner of the page during the execution of the `preload()` function. This approach is not very visually engaging and can be confusing for end-users who do not understand English or have visual impairments. \r\n\r\nA p5.js coder can replace \"Loading\" with a custom animation. This is mentioned in the [`preload()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/preload) and the [p5.js overview page](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview#loading-screen) but this option is still relatively hidden and not particularly beginner friendly.  See this [Coding Train tutorial on loading animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWgDKtvnjIU).\r\n\r\n### What's the solution?\r\n\r\nReplace the text-based \"Loading\" message with a visual loading animation. This animation could be a simple, universally recognized loading indicator (e.g., spinning circle) that provides a visual cue to users that content is being loaded without relying on text. An animated loader also better conveys the fact that _something is happening_. We can use the [`afterPreload` lifecycle event](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6422) to trigger hiding the loading animation. Possibly, the loading animation itself could be user-overridable via a `preloadAnimation()` function.\r\n\r\n### Pros (updated based on community comments)\r\n\r\n**Accessibility:** Enhances p5.js accessibility by providing a language-independent loading indicator.\r\n**User Experience:** Improves the user experience with a more engaging and informative visual cue during load times.\r\n**Internationalization:** Supports p5.js's goal of being globally accessible by removing language barriers in the loading process.\r\n**Visual identity:** The default loading animation could be an opportunity to include subtle elements of the p5.js visual identity like the pink color.\r\n\r\n### Cons (updated based on community comments)\r\n\r\n**Intrusivity:** Depending on its design, the loading animation may be perceived as intrusive. We can mitigate this by making it easy to change the animation or deactivate it, and add examples on the `preload()` reference page.\r\n\r\n### Proposal status\r\n\r\nUnder review",

In hopes that you could invest in making the widget accessible, i've listed out the critical issuesI've listed them below in hopes that these could be addressed in the next version of the component.\r\n\r\nIssue 1 (All Browsers): The icon doesn\u2019t have a label / name (see the 1st screenshot below), e.g. Country Code; and it doesn\u2019t read the selection, e.g. Spain +34\r\n![image](https://github.com/goveo/react-international-phone/assets/14338652/eb484d7a-9ca0-468b-a590-03d8a26f9bcc)\r\n\r\nIssue 2 (Safari Browser-only):  The dropdown randomly stops working by keyboard and / or freezes (without VoiceOver).\r\nIssue 3 (Safari Browser-only):  It crashes / freezes VoiceOver everytime I close the CC dropdown (either by selection or with ESC) (see the 2nd screenshot)\r\n![image](https://github.com/goveo/react-international-phone/assets/14338652/3a096398-1f1e-4bc9-811a-124d77630635)\r\n\r\nIssue 4 (All Browsers):  PGUP / PGDOWN doesn\u2019t move keyboard focus with the scroll behaviour, i.e. it scrolls the list but doesn\u2019t set the keyboard focus\r\n\r\nEven putting accessibility & VoiceOver aside the country code seems really janky in Safari. It looks like a memory leak of sorts? For example when selecting a CC from the list and alternating between keyboard & mouse Safari freezes / locks up. See #2 above.</div>",

Up to a degree of 200, the points/weights are available [here](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/MaxDet/MaxDet1.html).\nIncidentally, the same web page has one spherical design beyond what we have right now, for [degree 325](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/EffSphDes/ss.html).

The current design lacks modern aesthetics and user-friendly elements, hindering the overall user experience. By revamping the UI, we aim to enhance usability, engagement, and visual appeal. \r\n\r\n## Implementation Guidelines\r\n\r\nI will share the design of the theme, which includes:\r\n\r\n### Visual Refresh\r\n- The updated design will feature a modern and visually appealing layout, with attention to typography, color schemes, and spacing to create a cohesive and attractive interface.\r\n\r\n### Improved Navigation\r\n- The navigation elements will be restructured to make it more intuitive for users to explore different sections of the application. Clear calls-to-action will guide users to key features and content.\r\n\r\n### Responsive Design\r\n- Ensuring the UI is responsive across various devices and screen sizes is crucial for providing a seamless experience. The updated design will prioritize responsiveness to accommodate users accessing the application from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n- Accessibility considerations will be integrated into the design to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively navigate and interact with the application.\r\n\r\n### Performance Optimization\r\n- The UI will be optimized for performance to minimize loading times and provide a smooth browsing experience.\r\n\r\n### Development and Contribution Process\r\n- Fork the repository to begin working on this feature.\r\n- Maintain the integrity of existing code:\r\n-- Do not alter existing variable names, indexes, or IDs.\r\n-- Utilize the existing data structures and variables wherever possible.\r\n- Follow best practices for naming new variables and functions to ensure code clarity and maintainability.\r\n- Thoroughly comment your code to explain the logic and functionality of the added features.\r\n- Ensure that the new features do not negatively impact the existing functionalities of the music player.\r\n\r\n### Final Steps\r\n- Once development is complete, test the new features to verify they work as expected without introducing bugs or affecting the existing functionality.\r\n- Submit your changes via a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository for review.\r\n\r\nYour contribution will enhance the music listening experience by providing users with greater control over their playback options and ensuring uninterrupted enjoyment of their favorite songs.",

This results in inconsistent display and usability issues for users accessing the website on different devices.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n- The website UI should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and usability.\r\n- On mobile devices, elements should be appropriately sized and arranged for easy navigation and readability.\r\n- Tablet users should experience a layout that utilizes the available screen space effectively without compromising on functionality.\r\n- Laptop and desktop users should see a well-organized UI that makes efficient use of the larger screen real estate.\r\n- Across all viewports, text, images, buttons, and other elements should be legible, properly aligned, and aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Resolve:**\r\n1. Review the current CSS styles and layout structure to identify areas that need improvement for responsiveness.\r\n2. Implement media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and element positioning based on the viewport size.\r\n3. Test the website thoroughly on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that the UI changes are effective and consistent.\r\n4.

The categorization scheme we are using divides the elements into categories such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, metalloids, non-metals, halogens, noble gases, lanthanides, and actinides, totaling around eight to ten categories.\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\nThe goal is to find a color palette that provides sufficient contrast and accessibility to differentiate these categories effectively. This is crucial for ensuring that our periodic table is easily understandable and usable by individuals with varying levels of vision, including those with color vision deficiencies.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] Research existing color palettes used in data visualization that are known for their accessibility and contrast.\r\n- [ ] Compile a list of potential color palettes, including both categorical and continuous color schemes, as appropriate.\r\n- [ ] Evaluate the color palettes against accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).\r\n- [ ] Select a final color palette that will be used to differentiate the categories in our periodic table visualization.\r\n\r\n## References for Initial Research\r\n1.

The article \"Designing Accessible Color Systems\" by Stripe (https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems) discusses principles of choosing accessible color schemes in design.\r\n3. The Vega Datasets (https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets), which include examples of color palettes used in various data visualizations.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for Selection\r\n- The color palette must include a sufficient number of distinct colors to represent each of the categories in the periodic table.\r\n- Colors must be distinguishable not only for people with normal vision but also for those with common forms of color blindness.\r\n- The palette should support both digital displays and print formats, ensuring consistency across different mediums.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- It's essential to consider the color symbolism and avoid using colors that might convey incorrect information or cultural biases.\r\n- We aim to balance aesthetic appeal with practical considerations of accessibility and usability.\r\n\r\nPlease add any additional resources or considerations that could aid in the selection process.",

        "body": "**Problem Description:**\r\nThe current version of Open WebUI lacks the necessary customization options for the text-to-speech (TTS) output, including volume control, speech rate adjustment, pitch adjustment, and audio playback functionality for speaking out notifications. These limitations hinder the user experience and accessibility of the text-to-speech (TTS) feature.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nI propose the implementation of the following features to enhance the TTS output customization:\r\n1. A volume control slider to adjust the volume of the TTS output.\r\n2. A \"Speech Rate\" slider to adjust the speed of the TTS output.\r\n3. A \"Pitch\" slider enabling users to modify the voice pitch of the TTS output.\r\n4. An option to enable or disable audio playback for speaking out notifications.\r\n\r\n**Alternative solution:**\r\nOffer predefined volume, speed, & pitch options instead of a slider for a simpler interface.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered:**\r\nManually adjusting the device's overall volume or utilizing third-party applications to manipulate speech output and volume settings represents a workaround. However, this solution proves to be inconvenient for users, necessitating the addition of these much-needed features within Open WebUI.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nThis feature request focuses on improving the text-to-speech (TTS) feature's accessibility and overall user experience. Implementing these requested features, including volume, speed, and pitch adjustments, will significantly enhance user satisfaction and convenience. It's crucial to maintain compatibility with existing features, ensuring this customization suite does not adversely impact any existing functionalities or behaviors.",

To adhere to accessibility standards and ensure a seamless experience for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies, we need to ensure these tracker images are properly marked to be ignored by screen readers.\n\nAction Required:\n- Conduct an inventory of all tracker pixel images used within the application. These are typically small (often 1x1 pixels) images embedded in various parts of the application for tracking user interactions, analytics, or marketing purposes.\n- For each tracker pixel image identified, add a `role` attribute with the value of either \"none\" or \"presentation\".

To ensure our application is accessible and provides a seamless user experience for all users, including those using screen readers, we need to implement a systematic approach to manage the visibility of elements with respect to accessibility APIs.\n\nAction Required:\n- Conduct an audit across the application to identify all elements that are hidden using CSS techniques (such as opacity, height adjustments, text-indent, off-canvas methods, etc.).\n- For each identified element that is initially hidden:\n  - Ensure it is wrapped within an element with an `aria-hidden=\"true\"` attribute to indicate that it should be hidden from assistive technologies.\n  - When the element is meant to become visible (e.g., in response to user interaction), dynamically update the `aria-hidden` attribute to `\"false\"` to make it accessible to screen readers.\n- For elements that toggle visibility, implement a JavaScript solution that dynamically changes the `aria-hidden` attribute based on their visibility state.\n\nAdditional Information:\nThis approach aims to maintain the integrity of our application's accessibility by ensuring that elements are only exposed to screen readers when they are intended to be part of the user's current context.

This enhancement is crucial for providing a more inclusive and efficient browsing experience for users relying on assistive technologies.\n\nAction Required:\n- Audit all web pages within our application to identify the main landmarks (e.g., main content, menu, footer).\n- Implement hidden skip links at the beginning of each page that allow users to directly jump to these main landmarks. Ensure these links are accessible via keyboard navigation and are recognized by screen readers.\n- The skip links should be visually hidden but must become visible when they receive focus (e.g., when tabbed to by keyboard users).\n- Test the implementation thoroughly to ensure compatibility across different browsers and assistive technologies, confirming that the skip links improve navigation without introducing any layout or functionality issues.\n\nAdditional Information:\nSkip links should be strategically placed and coded to ensure they are the first focusable elements when navigating a page using a keyboard or screen reader. This feature is particularly important for users who navigate sequentially through content, as it allows them to quickly access different sections of the page without having to tab through every link or button in the navigation.\n\nBy prioritizing this task, we reaffirm our commitment to making our digital content accessible to all users, aligning with accessibility standards and best practices.

This documentation \r\nwill enhance accessibility for contributors and foster community engagement. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering this enhancement to the project documentation!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Feature Description\r\n\r\nAdd documentation detailing the contribution process for adding events to the repository using a specific JSON format.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nUsers who want to contribute events to the repository need clear instructions on how to format and submit event information.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a new section in the project documentation outlining the step-by-step process for contributing events:\r\n- Forking the repository\r\n- Cloning the forked repository\r\n- Adding event information in JSON format\r\n- Committing changes and creating a pull request (PR)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\nWe considered providing a video tutorial or conducting live workshops, but a written guide in the documentation is more accessible and scalable.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe documentation update depends on having a clear understanding of the JSON format required for event submissions.\r\n\r\nHere is the sample format for reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"Test Event 2024\",\r\n    \"shortName\": \"TE'24\",\r\n    \"shortDescription\": \"This is a simple One liner Description Test event\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Description Test event\",\r\n    \"imageUrl\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwzmsvp7f/image/fetch/q_75,f_auto,w_400/https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.insider.in%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fc_crop%2Cg_custom%2Fv1711572509%2Fkgg1nz7mkuaq8tltncgo.png\",\r\n    \"startDate\": null,\r\n    \"endDate\": null,\r\n    \"website\": \"www.ohmyscript.com\",\r\n    \"location\": {\r\n      \"title\": \"Saibeen Complex, Mangalore\",\r\n      \"lat\": \"12.26\",\r\n      \"lng\": \"122.24\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"type\": \"Free\",\r\n    \"presentationForm\": \"ONLINE\",\r\n    \"registrationLink\": \"http://ohmyscript.com/registration\",\r\n    \"mainOrganisers\": [],\r\n    \"hashTags\": [],\r\n    \"bannerLink\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"link\": \"\",\r\n        \"isActive\": true,\r\n        \"isMain\": true\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"socialAccounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"MASTODON\",\r\n        \"identified\": \"https://mastodon.social/@shravan20\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n",

We can add the tresholds, the actual values, the name of the assertion. If the actual value is close to the treshold, we should add a yellow dot. If the value is under the treshold, the dot should be red. Otherwise it will be green. Note that, as for now, the assertions are all errors, so we won't be able to generate the comment, since the check will fail before we can reach the comment generation.\r\n\r\nFor the yellow dot, we should consider a tolerance in the range of a 10% of the treshold, if available:\r\n* if the assertion requires a 100%, there is no available tolerance. We can only have a green (actual value of 100%) or a red dot (<100%);\r\n* if the assertion requires a 70%, then we will have a red dot if the actual value is <70%, a yellow dot with a value between 70 and 77 (10% of the treshold) and a green dot with a value >77%.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations will be done with numeric values instead of scores.\r\n\r\nDepends on #158 ",

I've read a bit of the source code I thought might be relevant but haven't had much luck yet.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell enabling access_kit mostly just \"works\" (about as good as an iOS app using VoiceOver which is pretty impressive), but it wasn't apparent that would be the case until I set everything up and ran VoiceOver with my app.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to see documentation explaining to ui-developers using egui:\r\n- how to create accessible experiences using access kit (high level summary)\r\n- documentation explaining what gets accessibility labels for free (label text, for example)\r\n- documentation explaining how to provide accessibility labels to widgets that don't have any.  For example, I have a component with a visual, non-textual representation that has an informational component that should be shared with screen reader users. How can I add accessibility labeling to that widget?\r\n\r\nIn addition to ui-developer docs, I'm also interested to know if the accessibility tree can be accessed at runtime in order to read things like \"label_a has text 'wowow'\". I'm interested in the possibility of using access kit as a way to drive out ui tests for egui.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nReading source code until I understand the capabilities, which I have greater risk misunderstanding without docs\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThanks for the great library! :)\r\n",

        "body": "### Overview\r\nWe are developing the UI for the first phase of the AutoGrader project, a Next.js application leveraging ShadcnUI for component styling. Our goal is to design a visually appealing interface that incorporates a dark theme inspired by the aesthetics of these websites:\r\n- [Next.js Official Site](https://nextjs.org)\r\n- [Shadcn UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com)\r\n- [NextUI Library](https://nextui.org)\r\n- [The Nirvana Labs](https://thenirvanalabs.com/)\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nThis initial UI iteration will focus on simplicity and functionality, enabling users to interact with the application effectively through a chat interface. The primary features to include are:\r\n\r\n1. **Assignment Creation**:\r\n   - Users can create new assignments via a chat interface.\r\n\r\n2. **Rubric Creation**:\r\n   - Users can develop rubrics interactively through the chat interface.\r\n\r\n3. **Workspace**:\r\n   - A dedicated area where users can organize and access their previous chats, assignments, and rubrics.\r\n\r\n4. **Persona Tab**:\r\n   - A feature allowing users to browse through various \"personas,\" complete with detailed descriptions of each persona\u2019s expertise, grading style, animated profile pictures, and voice clips. This facilitates persona-based assignment and rubric generation, as well as grading processes.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Features\r\nThe following functionalities are planned for future updates:\r\n   \r\n5. **Conversation Continuation**:\r\n   - Ability to retrieve and continue previous conversations.\r\n\r\n6. **Persona Management**:\r\n   - Options for users to browse existing personas or create new ones based on their preferences.\r\n\r\n7. **Persona Integration**:\r\n   - Integration of personas into the creation and editing processes for assignments and rubrics.\r\n\r\n8. **User Profile Customization**:\r\n   - Enhanced user profiles that allow for deeper personalization, including voice settings and previews of work generated by selected personas.\r\n\r\n### Design Considerations\r\n- **Theme**: Emphasize a sleek, modern look with extensive use of black and dark grey tones to ensure readability and aesthetic alignment with the suggested examples.\r\n- **User Experience**: Ensure the interface is intuitive and user-friendly, supporting seamless navigation between creating assignments, managing rubrics, and interacting with personas.\r\n- **Accessibility**: Design with accessibility in mind to accommodate all users, including those with visual impairments or other disabilities.\r\n\r\n### Feedback and Iteration\r\n- Initial designs will be reviewed in collaboration with the development team and potential end-users.\r\n- Feedback will be incorporated iteratively to refine the UI and ensure it meets the project's needs and user expectations.",

The browser's own scrollbar covers over any scrollbar which is on the right of the Settings windows. (Those are much too thin for me to use comfortably, I personally dislike the \"tiny thin\" styling which only expands to a thicker width _after_ you've hovered on it, as you need a lot of dexterity which not everyone has to get there in the first place and raises accessibility issues - but that's a separate gripe. For now I'm just talking about the ability to see the scrollbars **at all**)\r\n     \u26ac  Browser:   Chrome Version 124.0.6367.92 (Official Build) (64-bit). \r\n     \u26ac **HOW**:   Press the Settings icon. It's impossible to get to the scrollbars, or see that there are any.\r\n     \u26ac It may be relevant that I use Windows Accessibility -> Visual Effects -> \"Always show scrollbars\", because I detest floating / disappearing scrollbars in general. In general it is not good to assume there will never be a scrollbar when positioning things, as you never know!\r\n     \u26ac Then, un-maximise the Chrome window, so that it can be re-sized. Luckily, the Settings pane does not move. Now, the tiny scrollbars on the right side of the Settings pane are finally visible, and can be used, and I can get to the other options. (with a mouse wheel it is possible to scroll, _only if you know there are things to scroll in advance_, with a laptop, it's a lot harder depending on the configuration of trackpads etc.. None of this is as good as actually being able to see a scrollbar which is the visible indicator that you are not seeing all of the options and need to take action to get to what is not fitting on the screen.)\r\n        \u26ac Are any *Browser console errors shown? Not around the time of clicking Settings, no.\r\n        \u26ac  ImprovedTube Version: 4.826\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/assets/20239099/4f19730a-e9f1-4575-988c-8e74d15e4cf4)\r\n![image](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/assets/20239099/8ecfea25-fc1e-4386-9399-16d2b9e50e77)\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n",

We'll need this to be a multi selection dropdown that uses [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com) for accessibility - for instance a [combobox](https://headlessui.com/vue/combobox). The component would be made in the [dropdown directory](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/tree/main/frontend/components/dropdown).\r\n\r\nThe general style for the component can be found [on the designs on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_public_designs?type=design&node-id=2719%3A24686&mode=design&t=jTUMfp3ZcqY6KqEK-1), but personally I feel like we can improve this a bit. As far as props are concerned, we'll need to have two sections: one that's at the top that are the saved topics of the user, and one that's below a horizontal separator line that has the rest of the available topics. Each section could have a small header above such as `My topics` and `Other topics`.\r\n\r\nThis component would then replace the placeholder topics dropdown component on pages such as the [home page](https://activist.org/en/home).\n\n### Contribution\n\nHappy to support someone on this! This can be a `good first issue` for someone, but note that it's a bit more difficult :)",

Additionally, ensure that the Sheets screen becomes keyboard-navigable for enhanced accessibility.\r\n\r\n### Specifications:\r\n\r\n1. **Card-to-Button Transformation:**\r\n   - Replace the existing div elements used for cards with button elements.\r\n\r\n2. **Button Appearance:**\r\n   - Style the buttons to maintain the visual design consistency of the cards. This may include background colors, borders, and typography.\r\n\r\n3. **Accessibility:**\r\n   - Implement appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to ensure the buttons are fully accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies.\r\n\r\n4. **Keyboard Navigation:**\r\n   - Ensure that users can navigate through the buttons using keyboard controls.\r\n     - Users should be able to use the \"Tab\" key to move between buttons.\r\n     - Users should be able to activate the currently focused button by pressing the \"Enter\" key.\r\n     - Ensure a clear visual indicator (e.g., focus ring) for the active button.\r\n     \r\n5. **Focus Management:**\r\n   - Implement focus management to prevent users from getting trapped in the buttons loop.\r\n     - When the last button is focused and the user presses \"Tab,\" focus should move to the next interactive element (e.g., links or form inputs).\r\n\r\n6. **OnClick Functionality:**\r\n   - If the cards had onClick functionality, ensure that this functionality is preserved when the buttons are clicked.\r\n\r\n7. **Testing and QA:**\r\n   - Thoroughly test the button implementation to ensure that it performs equivalently to the previous div-based cards.\r\n   - Verify that keyboard navigation works as expected.",

This proposal suggests the addition of a GitHub button and a Dark Mode toggle button.\r\n\r\n### GitHub Button\r\n\r\nThe absence of a GitHub button in the project's navigation bar hinders users' ability to easily navigate to the GitHub repository associated with the project. This button should be prominently placed, allowing users to seamlessly access the GitHub page where they can contribute, start the project, or explore the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Dark Mode Toggle\r\n\r\nFurthermore, introducing a Dark Mode toggle button would cater to users who prefer a darker interface for various reasons, including reducing eye strain during nighttime use. This feature can improve accessibility and make the project more user-friendly.\r\n\r\nBy implementing these two features, we can enhance the overall user experience and engagement with the project. Users will find it easier to engage with the community, contribute to the project, and customize their viewing experience.\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/vatsalsinghkv/easy-fix/assets/110842297/98dabc42-5ba2-4990-9c6b-f6e3f68f6e7e)\r\n\n\n### \u2728 Browser\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\n### Checklist \ud83d\ude80\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar [issue](https://github.com/vatsalsinghkv/easy-fix/issues)\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vatsalsinghkv/easy-fix/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [X] I am willing to work on this issue (blank for no).",

        "body": "The code has undergone several enhancements:\r\n\r\nRouting Implementation:\r\n\r\nIntegrated BrowserRouter and Route components from the 'react-router-dom' library to enable multi-page navigation within the application. Added route definitions using Route components within a Switch, allowing different components to render based on the URL path. Additional Routes and Components:\r\n\r\nIntroduced an 'About' page by defining a new functional component called About to display specific content when the '/about' route is accessed. Created a 'Not Found' component named NotFound to handle 404 errors, rendering a message when a URL doesn't match any defined routes. Optimized Rendering and Theme Setup:\r\n\r\nUtilized the ReactDOM.render method to directly render the ImprovedApp component, simplifying the application setup. Configured Chakra UI's ChakraProvider with an extended theme that includes color and font settings. Also included a ColorModeScript for improved initial color mode handling for better accessibility. These changes have transformed the code into a more comprehensive and functional React application with enhanced navigation capabilities, distinct pages for various routes, and an optimized rendering structure with improved theming setup through Chakra UI's functionalities.",

It says you must leave this field \"empty\" in order to use the system language. However, this is wrong. None of the entries in the drop-down list is empty. The first one is \"(use system language)\", which is not empty.\r\n\r\nI guess the \"empty\" refers to the internal representation of the setting when editing minetest.conf by hand? Because in minetest.conf this is true. I think this tooltip needs to be written in a way so that it is always telling the truth.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to the settings page\r\n2. Go to Accessibility\r\n3. Hover the \"info i\" image next to the language setting",

By skipping levels people can get lost or miss entire sections of content using assistive tech.\r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\nTwo options here: first is to change the `<h4>` on each card to a `<h3>`.\r\n\r\nHowever there is also a `<h2>` called \"client\" which is not currently needed / is redundant. **A better option** may be to remove this `<h2>` and promote the current cards' `<h4>`s to `<h2>`s as this will be a more logical structure for the page.\r\n\r\n![screenshot of current page with a heading level 2 called \"client\" and then heading level 4s for each item](https://github.com/appwrite/website/assets/121672086/30a0183f-9eef-435b-a907-447a29df772c)\r\n\r\n## Relevant Success Criterion WCAG\r\n[Info and Relationships in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships)\r\n[Technique using heading levels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H42)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nGood first issue, but needs input from Appwrite to which solution they would prefer.\r\n\r\n[Found on stream on 2023-10-25](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1959992199)\n\n### \ud83d\udc40 Have you spent some time to check if this issue has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \ud83c\udfe2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)",

This is because the `title` attribute is intended to provide additional information to screen reader users.\r\n\r\n- The `aria-label` attribute is a way more important for providing accessibility information to screen reader users. The `aria-label` attribute is an Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attribute that can be used to provide a label for an element. This label is then read aloud by screen readers, providing additional information about the element to the user.\r\n\r\n- In general, the `aria-label` & `title` attributes are preferred for providing accessibility information to screen reader users.\r\n\r\n- You can consider to assign this issue to me to make the site accessible for screen readers\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (Changes are going to made for these elements)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/yash19sinha/coffee-bean/assets/92252895/d1fea804-957b-4fda-ab5d-054952ee4352)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n- I'm a **Hacktoberfest23** Contributor",

We can also integrate [`clap-mangen`](https://crates.io/crates/clap-mangen) for generating a manpage. I see two ways of doing this:\r\n\r\n- have a separate binary (`cargo-shuttle-mangen`) (see [this](https://github.com/orhun/halp/blob/main/src/bin/mangen.rs) example)\r\n- use the build script (see [this](https://github.com/orhun/kmon/blob/master/build.rs) example)\r\n\r\nHere's why having a manpage is good:\r\n\r\n> Having a man page is advantageous because it serves as local and offline documentation for commands or programs, offering users quick and standardized access to crucial information. Its consistency, comprehensive details, and integration with the command line make it a valuable resource for understanding and utilizing software effectively. The accessibility of man pages promotes inclusivity and facilitates scripting and automation, contributing to an enhanced user experience in various computing environments.\r\n\n\n### Duplicate declaration\n\n- [X] I have searched the issues and this improvement has not been requested before.",

While browsers expose the name, VO on macOS and Narrator with Edge (specifically if using Narrator key + left/right arrows to navigate) are really the only ones that effectively expose the name - unless the element is made focusable.  And then that's a weird hodgepodge of the name sometimes being announced but the role often not... but also, why would anyone be making a time element focusable?\r\n\r\nI am not sure what need there is for a time role/element to be named.  is this something that should remain / AT have bugs filed to work out UX?

The letterspacing has also been adjusted to match.

This can improve page load times and overall performance.\r\n- **Editability:** SVGs can be easily edited and styled with CSS, providing more flexibility for design changes in the future.\r\n- **Accessibility:** SVGs can be made accessible to screen readers, improving the website\u2019s overall accessibility.",

Inspecting the source reveals that there's actually only one function; the reference page for the other function appears to have been generated by inline docs that use the wrong function name.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there's a [reference page for `vertexNormal()`](https://p5js.org/es/reference/#/p5/vertexNormal), but that function is never defined in the p5.js codebase. The reference page is a stub that points to a file in the source that names `vertexNormal()` in the inline docs but implements the documented function with the name `normal()`. The naming mismatch between the inline docs and the implementation seems to have been present since this functionality was first introduced  in commit 072fac9949f176b702e6f7e8b625e28c7e730b66.  Fortunately, the mismatch is only present internally, in the version of the feature defined on p5.RendererGL.\r\n\r\nLike the internal version, the user-facing version is implemented with `normal()` as the function name. [Its reference page](https://p5js.org/es/reference/#/p5/normal) is complete and uses the correct function name. So, this bug seems to have an easy fix: Replace `vertexNormal` in the documentation on lines [170](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/cea9e09242d5d69bb83388b6fd03e8a09f1fdeed/src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js#L170) and [176](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/cea9e09242d5d69bb83388b6fd03e8a09f1fdeed/src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js#L176) of `webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js` with `normal`. Since this is the only mention of `vertexNormal()` in the inline docs, I'm guessing this should effectively delete the associated page from the p5.js website's reference.",

        "body": "## **Introduction**\r\nHello friends! \ud83d\udc4b This GitHub issue serves as a place for discussing the trajectory of our project. When I first started this project, I wanted to scratch an itch, aiming to address the lack of Rust's accessibility in the data science, analysis, and ML domains for beginners. In this issue, I'd like to delve into some questions that may have crossed your minds:\r\n\r\n### 1. **Why publish for TDS on Medium and not push everything in one place here on GitHub?**\r\n   The primary reason for publishing articles on TDS is [their policy against AI-generated content](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-note-about-ai-generated-text-4ce3be86f599), a stance I support. This decision was made anticipating potential accusations from many of you of my heavy reliance on language models. While I may lightly use LLMs, and sometimes not at all, this choice aligns with the principles of platforms like TDS.\r\n\r\n### 2. **Why did you stop writing these articles?**\r\n   The decision to halt new article publications arises from the lack of financial support. Unfortunately, platforms like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global), [Paypal](https://www.zoho.com/in/billing/kb/payment-gateways/which-countries-support-paypal.html), and [GitHub Sponsors](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#supported-regions-for-github-sponsors) and most e-wallets are not available in my country, Lebanon. To sustain this intensive work, I am now involved in writing books, which will serve as a means of financial support. If you'd like to support this project, please feel free to buy a physical copy of any upcoming books.\r\n\r\n### 3. **Will you continue publishing new notebooks?**\r\n   Absolutely! The journey doesn't conclude with the completion of my current books; it's a mere checkpoint. I'm committed to the ongoing exploration of new ideas and the publication of new notebooks. The future holds a canvas of unknown territories, and your engagement and support are the driving forces propelling this project forward. Together, we'll continue shaping the narrative and celebrating the joy of intellectual discovery. Your love means the world, and I'm excited to embark on this continued journey with you. \u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas regarding the future direction of the project in the comments below. Let's embark on this journey together! \ud83c\udf1f",

As far as I can tell there is no setting that allows the instance admin to switch off autoplay for people who aren't logged in?\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nThere should be a setting on the admin's GUI controls which allows admins to optionally set autoplay off by default.",

This component should allow users to drag PDF files onto it, change styles on hover, and redirect to the PDF renderer component upon dropping the file.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements:\r\n\r\n1. **Drag and Drop Functionality:**\r\n   - Users should be able to drag and drop PDF files onto the designated area.\r\n   - The component should handle the dropped file and initiate the redirect process.\r\n\r\n2. **Hover Effects:**\r\n   - Apply visual styling changes to indicate the drag-and-drop area when a user is hovering over it.\r\n\r\n3. **File Input as an Alternative:**\r\n   - Include a file input element as an alternative to dragging and dropping for accessibility purposes.\r\n\r\n4. **Redirect to PDF Renderer:**\r\n   - Upon dropping a file, redirect the user to the PDF renderer component with the dropped PDF file.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Guidelines:\r\n\r\n1. **React Component:**\r\n   - Create a React component named `Droppable`.\r\n\r\n2. **Styling:**\r\n   - Implement styles to visually enhance the drag-and-drop area and provide feedback to users.\r\n\r\n3. **Drag and Drop Handling:**\r\n   - Implement logic to handle drag enter, drag leave, drag over, and drop events.\r\n\r\n4. **File Input Handling:**\r\n   - Include a hidden file input element that triggers the same logic as drag and drop when a file is selected.\r\n",

I understand that the feature request will be dismissed otherwise.\n- [X] This issue contains only one feature request.\n\n### Feature description\n\nI like simplicity, I love how mLauncher is built!! I'm also using many apps. This creates problems for me because I can either keep the App List simple with around 6 app shortcuts visible (in which case I'll have to use the menu to access other apps which in turn decreases productivity) or I can increase the number of app shortcuts (in which case the main sceen would become too cluttered). So I kept wondering, how can you make this more powerful but keep simple at the same time? What I came up with is Multiple App Lists. For the record when I say Multiple I mean up to three.\r\n\r\nIn the Settings / Homescreen area you could insert a new setting called `Number of App Lists` with possible values: 1, 2 or 3 and under it you could insert settings called `App List 1 No of Shortcuts`, `App List 2 No of Shortcuts` and `App List 3 No of Shortcuts` with the usual values. These App Lists could be accessed by swiping left and right.\n\n### Additional information\n\nWhat do you think developer and community? Do you like this idea or not? Do you think it could be implemented or not? Would you change something (and if yes then what) about the way I think this could work?\n\n### Terms and Conditions\n\n- [X] I have read all the rules above and filled in the requiered fields to the best of my ability.\n- [X] I accept that if I fail to follow the rules stated above that I will recieve a 30 day block.",

So it's not unexpected that there are inconsistencies in the p5.js API and missing descriptions in the p5.js reference. After describing the problem in more detail, I'll propose a standardization to help us solve it. I'm not sure if any of these issues will be addressed by recent work on the documentation or the upcoming p5.js website, but the usage issues would remain either way.\r\n\r\n#### Using defaults\r\nThe naming of default values is inconsistent: many default values are named, but some are not. Here are two examples of unnamed default values:\r\n\r\n1. The [`beginShape()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape) function has an optional `kind` parameter. Its default value has a meaningful interpretation, but it has no name. This prevents us from giving [`beginContour()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginContour) a `kind` parameter, as we plan to do for [#6560](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6560). [^1]\r\n3. As another example, [`debugMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/debugMode) has three possible modes, but only two of them are named: `GRID` and `AXES`. Based on the description of the mode parameter, users may think these are the only two modes, and they may ask \"Which is the default?\" The answer: neither of them.\r\n\r\n#### Documenting defaults\r\nDetermining default values from the reference is more difficult than necessary. Even when default values are identified, they're identified in inconsistent places, sometimes with inaccurate descriptions. Consider the examples from above:\r\n\r\n1. In the reference page for `beginShape()`, the default value is referred to only implicitly, and it isn't identified at all in the parameter description. The reference refers to the same parameter as both \"kind\" and \"mode,\" so it's not always clear what's being described. It also describes the default shapes as polygons; however, the actual default shapes don't need to be closed and their segments don't need to be straight.\r\n2. In the reference page for `debugMode()`, the default mode is described in different levels of detail throughout the body of the function description, which spans multiple paragraphs. The default mode isn't specified in the parameter description, and it's never named. (Seeing the effect of the default setting also requires the user to interact with each example in a specific way that's not entirely specified in the verbal description.)\r\n\r\n#### Additional examples\r\nWe've seen two examples so far: `beginShape()` and `debugMode()`. However, there are other mode functions: [`angleMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/angleMode), [`colorMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/colorMode), [`ellipseMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipseMode), [`rectMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rectMode), [`blendMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/blendMode),[`imageMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/imageMode), and [`textureMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textureMode). Fortunately, all these other mode functions already have named defaults, but none of their reference pages identify those defaults in the parameter descriptions. These are just some examples. _There may be other functions separate from these with optional parameters whose default values aren't named or identified._\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nExplicitly identifying default values in a consistent location\u2014and giving them descriptive names\u2014will make them easier to find and understand. After all, it'll be easier to write clear descriptions once we have clear names. To help us implement these changes, I propose two policies and three stages of work.\r\n\r\n#### Policies\r\n1. Always provide a descriptive name for default values of string (or [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)) parameters. (In the case of `beginShape()`, `SEGMENTS` is a reasonable name. In the case of `debugMode()`, `GRID_AND_AXES` is a reasonable name.)\r\n2. Always identify default values by name in the parameter descriptions, using the [`[parameterName = defaultName]` syntax](https://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/index.html#param). \r\n\r\n_Edit: In the original post, the [`@default`](https://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/index.html#default) syntax was mistakenly cited above._\r\n\r\n#### Stages of work\r\nTo implement these policies, we can go through the p5.js reference and make some simple changes. I propose we do the work in three stages:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add the proposed policies to the [p5.js contributor docs](https://p5js.org/contributor-docs/#/contributing_documentation).\r\n- [ ] Go through the reference pages for all functions/methods, and introduce names for any unnamed default values.\r\n- [ ] Go through the reference pages for all functions/methods, and identify default values in parameter descriptions. \r\n\r\nTo limit the scope of this issue, I'm _not_ proposing we change the language in the descriptions of the functions themselves (i.e. the descriptions at the top of their reference pages). As part of #6560, I'm planning to create a separate issue with proposed language for at least some of the functions under the [Shape section](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape) of the p5.js reference: `beginContour()`, `beginShape()`, `bezierVertex()`, `curveVertex()`, `endContour()`, `endShape()`, `quadraticVertex()`, `vertex()`, and `normal()`. I've already updated the descriptions for some of these.\r\n\r\n### How you can help!\r\nThe p5.js reference contains quite a few functions, but we can easily divide up the work according to sections in the p5.js reference, since it's already so well organized. If we reach a consensus about making these changes, I can open up separate issues for each stage; that will help us to discuss any new names before we introduce them to the public API, for example. \r\n\r\nHere's what you can do to start:\r\n\r\n1. Share your opinion on the proposed policies! It'd be good to reach a consensus on them before making any changes.\r\n2. Comment on this issue to indicate that you're interested in implementing the policies, and indicate how many functions you expect to have time to update (a single function, a group of functions in the p5.js reference, or all functions).\r\n\r\n[^1]: We want contours to use the containing shape's kind when called with no arguments. So, if the containing shape has a non-default kind like `POINTS`, `beginContour()` won't be able to go back to the default kind without naming it.",

This behavior can be enhanced to provide a more user-friendly experience by implementing custom toast notifications.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Steps:\r\n\r\n- Custom Toast Component: Develop a custom React component for the toast notification, including styling and animations.\r\n\r\n- Context Integration: Integrate the toast notification system into the application context for global accessibility.\r\n\r\n- Success and Error Handling: Implement logic to display success and error messages based on the outcomes of registration and sign-in actions.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n- Create a custom toast notification system without relying on external libraries. This custom solution will include the following features:\r\n\r\n1. Context Integration: The toast notification system will be integrated into the application context, allowing it to be easily accessed and used throughout the application.\r\n\r\n2. Success and Error Messages: Implement the capability to display success and error messages based on the outcome of the registration or sign-in actions.\r\n\r\n3.

        "body": "### Background\r\nOur project currently uses `changesets/action` to automatically generate releases or pre-release snapshots upon each commit to the `main` branch, streamlining our release management. However, there's an opportunity to enhance our development workflow by not only automating snapshot releases for pull requests in development branches but also by providing immediate, actionable information to testers and reviewers.\r\n\r\n### Feature Request\r\nAlong with implementing snapshot releases for each commit in a pull request within our development branches, I propose we extend our automation to include automatic posting of installation commands in the pull request comments by a bot. This will give developers and reviewers immediate access to the commands needed to install and test the snapshot release, thereby improving efficiency and clarity in our testing and review processes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Functionality\r\n- **Snapshot Release on Pull Request Creation**: Generate a snapshot release corresponding to the latest commit when a new pull request is created in a development branch.\r\n- **Update Snapshot on New Commits**: Update the snapshot release to reflect the latest state of the pull request if additional commits are pushed.\r\n- **Auto-Comment Installation Commands**: After each snapshot release creation or update, a bot should automatically post a comment in the pull request with the installation commands or links necessary for testing the snapshot.\r\n- **Integration with `changesets/action`**: Seamlessly integrate this feature with our existing `changesets/action` usage, extending its functionality to accommodate the new requirements.\r\n\r\n### Use Case Example\r\n1. **Developer and Reviewer Workflow**:\r\n   - A developer submits a pull request from a new feature branch.\r\n   - A snapshot release is automatically generated, and a bot posts a comment in the pull request with installation commands like `npm install your-package@snapshot-version`.\r\n   - Reviewers and testers use the provided commands to install the snapshot release easily, ensuring their review is based on the exact state of the application as proposed in the pull request.\r\n   - If the developer pushes new commits, the snapshot release is updated, and the bot posts a new comment with updated installation commands.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- **Immediate Accessibility**: Developers and reviewers have immediate access to the exact commands needed to install and test the snapshot release, reducing time spent searching for package versions or installation instructions.\r\n- **Enhanced Communication**: Automatically providing installation commands ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page regarding which version of the application is under review.\r\n- **Streamlined Development Process**: Automating this part of the process further streamlines the development workflow, allowing developers and reviewers to focus more on the content of the pull request and less on administrative tasks.\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n- We need to ensure that the bot's comments are clear, concise, and accurately reflect the current state of the snapshot release.\r\n- Mechanisms should be in place to prevent comment clutter, such as editing the existing comment with updated commands rather than posting new comments for each commit.\r\n- Proper versioning and identification of snapshot releases are crucial to avoid confusion with official releases.\r\n",

In our use case, we use longer form descriptions similar to a short invitation letter and I think many other \"Forms\" users are doing the same.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the bad readability is the use of the `var(--color-text-maxcontrast)` CSS variable which should be used for \" secondary text like sublines, timestamps, and similar\" ([source: nextcloud docs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/design/foundations.html)). But in contrast to the form question descriptions, the form description is not a short secondary text like a subline. Therefore, instead the `var(--color-main-text)` CSS variable should be used, which has a higher contrast and should be used for \"main text\", according to the Nextcloud Docs.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a form\r\n2. Add a form description\r\n3. The description is hard to read due to bad contrast, both in bright and dark mode, and both when editing and viewing the form\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe description should be easily readable. The Markdown support for descriptions highlights that users may want to use descriptions for longer text. Such longer text should not use secondary text color but main text color with good contrast. This is also required for better accessibility and to be in line with the Nextcloud theming guidelines.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nCurrent status with bad readability. **Screenshots of my expected design are expandable below.**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/assets/66086922/92584384-a1d2-422f-8a2d-1b433f6e6bf7)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/assets/66086922/355b004f-c3fa-4e6e-b46e-6597a7855443)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshots of much better readability with var(--color-main-text)</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/assets/66086922/f90deeec-092d-4aa9-941c-7c21a869fbd0)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms/assets/66086922/025b3be3-f32e-4e52-8e00-3cb0019babe5)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Nextcloud (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Nextcloud-Version: [28.0.0]\r\n- Forms-Version: [4.0.0 (main branch from 2024/01/16)]\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [Ubuntu]\r\n - Browser [Chrome]\r\n - Version [120.0.6099.216]",

OR\r\nB) Add an [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live) region on the status message and trigger it after the page loads.\r\n\r\nYou may also consider changing this form to submit with ajax so screen reader users are not sent to the top of the page as happens with a refresh.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nScreen reader users don't easily know when a an error occurs.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Turn on a screen reader such as VoiceOver or NVDA.\r\n2. Go to the My Account > Addresses page.\r\n3. Click edit on one of the addresses.\r\n4. Leave at least one required field blank and submit the form.\r\n5. Listen as the page reloads and observe there's no announcement about the error.\n\n### WordPress Environment\n\nN/A\n\n### Isolating the problem\n\n- [X] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\n- [X] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woo.com/products/storefront/).\n- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.",

Enhancing the ReadMe in this way is highly valuable; it's often the first point of interaction for users and potential contributors.\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributors to take up this task and support the community in making our documentation more inclusive and user-friendly.

I have to first switch it to _Paragraph_ and then to the desired _Heading 2-6_. \r\n\r\nThis only happens with _Heading 1_, all other heading levels are fine.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nI'll try to replicate it in codesandbox when I have the time.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n1. write some text and style it as Heading 1\r\n2. with that text selected or having the cursor in it, open the `MenuSelectHeading` dropdown\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nAll heading levels in the dropdown should be enabled and selectable. \r\n\r\nE.g. it should be possible to select the option _Heading 2_, which should switch the selected/focused text to the Heading 2 style.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nAll heading levels are disabled and cannot be selected. You have to first select _Paragraph_, and then the desired _Heading 2-6_.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sjdemartini/mui-tiptap/assets/11568348/cd0893ff-7174-4edc-a722-96fb938f2dba)\r\n\r\n\r\n### System (please complete the following information):\r\n\r\n- mui-tiptap version: ^1.8.6\r\n- tiptap version: ^2.2.3\r\n- Browser: Edge\r\n- Node version: 20.11.0\r\n- OS: Pop!_OS 22.04\r\n- \"react\": \"^18.2.0\"\r\n- \"typescript\": \"^4.5.4\",\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI compared this behaviour with your [Codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/mui-tiptap-demo-3zl2l6?file=%2Fsrc%2FuseExtensions.ts%3A153%2C17), and there it works fine - you can switch heading levels directly. I tried replicating the codesandbox code as closely as possible in my project - using the same versions of the tiptap and mui-tiptap packages, using the `HeadingWithAnchor` instead of the basic `Heading` extension, same order of the extensions. Nothing helped. The older package versions caused weird internal \"cannot access property of undefined\" errors. \r\n\r\n#### Code excerpts:\r\n##### Editor definition:\r\n```js\r\nconst editor = useEditor({\r\n

The button should be easily identifiable and recognizable by its function.\r\n\r\n**Accessibility:**\r\nEnsure that the button is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This might involve providing text labels for the button and ensuring proper contrast and keyboard accessibility.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details:**\r\n\r\n*Database Structure:*\r\nArchived chats could be moved to a new table in the database, allowing for better organization and easier retrieval of data.\r\n\r\n*Front-end Changes:*\r\n- A new archive button for each chat element on click, located to the left-hand side of the chat title for the conversation. This button would allow users to archive the chat with a single click.\r\n- A new \"Archived Chats\" option could be added somewhere within the Settings menu, accessible by clicking on the username in the bottom left side of the UI. This new `Archived Chats` option when clicked, would display a list of all archived chats, allowing users to search, filter, and manage their archived conversations.\r\n\r\n*Back-end Integration:*\r\n- Admins would have the ability to control the archive expiration period, setting the duration for which chats remain archived before being automatically deleted or moved back to the active chat list.\r\n- Create a function for archiving chats: The back-end can include a function that moves chats from the active chat table to the archived chat table, updating the chat status accordingly.\r\n- Update the UI with the new status: The user interface would be updated to reflect the new chat status, displaying the appropriate visual cues and options based on whether a chat is active or archived.\r\n\r\n**Benefits to Users:**\r\n\r\n* Improve organization: Provide users with more control over their chat history by allowing them to archive conversations they no longer need to see in their active chat list. This will help users maintain a clean and organized chat interface, making it easier to find and manage their conversations.\r\n* Enhance user experience: By providing an Archive Chat button, users can quickly find and revisit old conversations without having to scroll through or search through a large number of chats. This will save users time and effort, improving their overall experience with the Open WebUI platform.\r\n* Streamline communication management: Users can better manage and organize their chat history by using the archive feature instead of deleting or ignoring conversations. This will help users maintain a tidy chat interface while preserving important conversations for future reference.\r\n* Improved accessibility: The new \"Archived Chats\" option, accessible from the user options, ensures that users can easily find and manage their archived conversations. This will help users quickly locate and restore archived chats, improving their overall experience with the Open WebUI platform.\r\n* Admin control: Admin users will have the ability to control the archiving feature, including managing user permissions and access levels. Additionally, admins would have the ability to control the archive expiration period, setting the duration for which chats remain archived before being automatically deleted or moved back to the active chat list. This will help admins maintain a clean and organized chat environment, ensuring that users can efficiently manage their conversations.\r\n\r\nThis feature request proposes adding an Archive Chat button to allow users to temporarily move chat conversations out of their current active chat list without deleting them entirely.

Please describe.**\r\nYes, the feature request is related to the problem of manually switching between light and dark modes on different applications, which can be frustrating and challenging for many users, including those with visual impairments or sensitivities to certain light levels. Specifically, the issue lies in the current manual theme selection feature in Open WebUI, which does not incorporate the user's system light/dark mode setting.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe proposed solution is to add a new theme option labeled `System` in Open WebUI. This option will enable Open WebUI to automatically switch between light and dark modes based on the user's systems setting. This feature would improve accessibility for users with visual impairments or sensitivities to certain light levels and reduce the need for manual intervention. Enabling the `System` theme by default upon the first sign up for Open WebUI (the admin account) would better suit the needs of those users and provide a consistent user experience across all applications. Additionally, this would allow users to immediately experience the benefits of the system-wide light/dark mode theme setting without having to manually change their settings.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative solution considered is manually switching themes within Open WebUI. However, this approach would not provide a consistent user experience across all applications and would require manual intervention.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIncorporating the system's light/dark mode setting into Open WebUI's theme settings would provide a more seamless and accessible user experience for all users. This feature would be particularly beneficial for those users who have visual impairments or sensitivities to certain light levels. By automatically switching between light and dark modes based on the user's system setting, Open WebUI can provide a more user-friendly and accessible platform for all users.",

This setup module is required in order to connect the module and make available the `SettingsView` and `SettingsEdit` component(s).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 10 56 54](https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/assets/90871/56581c83-54dc-443f-8684-fcfc1a0defb0)\r\n\r\nThis `SetupComponent` should contain the necessary main `SetupMain`container component as well as the `SetupForm` component and applicable form with fields. At present, the only field required is the `Ads Conversion ID` field, as it appears in the `SettingsView` and `Settings Edit` components, see #8251\r\n\r\nSee the applicable design doc here: \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1APuSv95bf62uhzlaFlW6jPrzPKy1avpRYd9W1MSAAJo/edit?resourcekey=0-UuynlcUz9CoubgldR6Z5sg#heading=h.lzbos67ly9f6\r\n\r\nSee the applicable setup view Figma design here:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=121-1080&mode=design&t=sbmhawdoXe4KNC0S-0\r\n\r\nSee the applicable post-setup Figma design here:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=60-788&mode=design&t=sbmhawdoXe4KNC0S-0\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n_Do not alter or remove anything below. The following sections will be managed by moderators only._\r\n\r\n## Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n* A new component should be created that maps to the `SetupComponent` object during module registration\r\n    * A suitable `SetupMain` component should be created to reference above, see the existing GA4 component at `assets/js/modules/analytics-4/components/setup/SetupMain.js` for an idea of how this is configured. Note that the Ads Module component would be far simpler in nature, however.\r\n    * Create a suitable `SetupForm` component to render within the `SetupMain` component above (see [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=121-1109&mode=design&t=VpLcHXYVl1Kczl6T-4))\r\n        * Create the necessary `form` component with CTA to render and save a single `Ads Conversion ID` field.\r\n        * This field should confirm to the existing Ads options storage patterns, see #8251 for an example\r\n        * The field should contain the same validation and appearance logic as carried out in #8251, the input component therein should be reused \r\n    * The Ads module should be able to be successful set up and be connected following completion of this form\r\n        * Upon successful setup, the user should be redirected to the dashboard with the applicable notification banner as shown in the [Figma design here](https://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=60-788&mode=design&t=sbmhawdoXe4KNC0S-0)\r\n    * Saving states and indicators should be used accordingly, as per the existing Site Kit design patterns\r\n\r\n## Implementation Brief\r\n\r\n * [x] Set `requiresSetup: true` in `assets/js/modules/ads/datastore/base.js`.\r\n\r\n* [x] Create a new component `assets/js/modules/ads/components/setup/SetupMain.js`:\r\n   * [x] This component should simply load the `SetupForm` component with icon and header as in the [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=121-1080&mode=design&t=cAeNb2Jp6omVBT6e-0).\r\n\r\n * [x] As in #8344, migrate the `assets/js/modules/ads/components/common/AdsConversionIDTextField.js` component from analytics-4 and move the `isValidAdsConversionID` validation into a new file: `assets/js/modules/ads/utils/validation.js`\r\n\r\n * [x] Create a new component `assets/js/modules/ads/components/setup/SetupForm.js`:\r\n    * [x] This component should simply load the `AdsConversionIDTextField` component wrapped in a `div.googlesitekit-setup-module__inputs`.\r\n    * [x] This component should use the form and submitChanges structure as in `assets/js/modules/analytics/components/setup/SetupForm.js` to save changes before calling the `finishSetup` prop function.\r\n    * [x] Update the form as required to match the [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/THG1FJw5SaUxmiq38Mkf1x/Ads?type=design&node-id=121-1080&mode=design&t=cAeNb2Jp6omVBT6e-0).\r\n\r\n * [x] Import and pass the new `SetupMain` component to the `SetupComponent` key in the module registration in `assets/js/modules/ads/index.js`.\r\n\r\n * [x] Show the new style connection banner when the connection is complete.\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n* [x] Move the validation tests for the `isValidAdsConversionID` validation function into a new test file: `assets/js/modules/ads/utils/validation.test.js`.\r\n* [x] Add a story for the new `SetupForm` component.\r\n* [x] Fix any broken VSTs\r\n\r\n## QA Brief\r\n\r\n* Enable the `adsModule` feature flag.\r\n* Go to the Site Kit settings and connect the new Ads module using the new module setup flow.\r\n* Once connected the user should be redirected to the plugin dashboard with the banner confirming the connection:\r\n   * This banner should be dismissed by clicking \"Got It\".\r\n* Test disconnecting the module by going to the plugin settings, opening the Ads module accordion, clicking \"Edit\", then \"Disconnect\":\r\n    * The disconnect modal warning should show with the features list.\r\n    * The module should be able to be disconnected. \r\n\r\n## Changelog entry\r\n\r\n* Add setup flow to Ads Module.\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nThe current command-line interface (CLI) for accessing Robotics Academy creates a barrier to entry for users who are less familiar with technical commands. To make the Academy more accessible and user-friendly, a desktop application is necessary to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier navigation and interaction.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe propose the development of a robust desktop application for Robotics Academy that operates seamlessly across Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. This application should offer an intuitive and visually appealing interface that allows users to access all features and resources of the Academy without the need for complex CLI commands. Key features of this desktop app should include:\r\n\r\nUser-friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface that enables users to easily navigate through different sections of the Robotics Academy, such as courses, projects, forums, and resources.\r\n\r\nCourse Management: The ability for users to enroll in courses, track their progress, and access course materials directly from the desktop application.\r\n\r\nProject Workspace: Integration of a project workspace where users can create, edit, and collaborate on robotics projects using built-in tools and simulators.\r\n\r\nCommunity Interaction: Seamless integration with the Robotics Academy community forums, allowing users to ask questions, share insights, and engage with other learners directly from the app.\r\n\r\nOffline Access: Capability to access certain Academy resources and course materials offline, enabling users to continue learning even without an internet connection.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWhile the current CLI provides access to Robotics Academy, it requires users to have a certain level of technical expertise and familiarity with command-line operations. Developing a desktop application eliminates this barrier by providing a GUI that caters to users of all skill levels, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of the Academy.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBy developing a desktop application for Robotics Academy, we aim to democratize access to robotics education and empower learners from diverse backgrounds to explore and engage with robotics concepts in a user-friendly environment. This feature request aligns with our commitment to fostering inclusivity and accessibility within the robotics community.",

        "body": "# Issue: Building Registration Page\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\nThe goal is to implement a new user registration system, including frontend and backend changes, to enhance our application's accessibility and user management. This involves creating a link to a registration page below the login screen, designing the form, adjusting the backend for new user registration, and reflecting these changes in the admin dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n### Frontend\r\n- [ ] **Registration Page Link**: Below the login screen, include a text \"no account register?\" or sign up button similar, which links to the registration page. Check https://dribbble.com/tags/register-ui for inspiration or use my rotary button component.\r\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Use Vue (https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)  -- make sure you understand basic in the composition api \r\n        - Style guide: I use SASS in vue components and in my global css located in assets folder : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b_q5NV4bUc&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMYRhK9vRPatSlb-9r0aKgh&index=7 , tailwind : https://tailwindcss.com/ , and for premade components : https://primevue.org/  --- primevue is complicated i suggest you just use tailwind learn it off you tube its super easy \r\n        - Implement Vue Router 4 for navigation ((https://router.vuejs.org/)). Look for the folder `router` and add a new route for the registration form.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Registration Form**: We need to collect all necessary information for a new user. You can either reuse the `UserForm` component or create a new one based on it.\r\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Review the `UserForm` component for reference. Decide on reuse or duplication and modification for the registration form's purposes. You MUST validate on frontend the users info use and understand https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/ ... you could create your own though if you want but this might take a lot of time.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Admin Dashboard Updates**: For prospective users, add a new side menu item visible to district admin and district chair admins. This should include an icon, a new route, and a access filter to ensure only authorized users can see this item.\r\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Create a new route for the admin dashboard frontend.\r\n        - Implement a new access for this item, i have an access composable you will add new access there.\r\n        - Display all prospective users for the admin's district using the `BaseDisplayTable` component to maintain consistency and leverage built-in functionalities such as pagination. Include \"Edit\" and \"Deny/Accept User\" buttons. Also have a deny/accept user buttons in the form when the admin is viewing the prospective user \r\n\r\n### Backend\r\n- [ ] **New API Endpoint for Registration**: Develop a new API call to handle user registration. This may involve database schema changes, such as adding a column to the existing users table or creating a new table (the former is recommended).\r\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Study Adonis JS backend MVC model and ORM. https://v5-docs.adonisjs.com/guides/introduction\r\n        - Create a new migration to add a column to the users table, update the users model, and develop the new API endpoint for user registration make sure you use the design scheme as i shown you. I.e controller, service, repository. \r\n\r\n- [x] #475\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Utilize the Pinia store for accessing the currently logged-in user's ID from frontend to send to backed . Examine the `userStore` in the frontend stores folder. https://pinia.vuejs.org/\r\n        - Ensure the admin can edit, accept or deny the prospective user's information. On accept if user was edited update information and mark that user as real user. REMEMBER these proceptive users should not appear in other calls ... So design and alter other calls in backend that calls users  to ensure that they do not pull those prospective users. \r\n\r\n### Bonus\r\n- [ ] **Email Notification on Denial**: If a user is denied, automatically send them an email informing them of the account denial, with a reply-to email address specified in the `.env`.\r\n    - **Action Items**:\r\n        - Implement email functionality using the environmental variables for the sender's address.\r\n        - Ensure the deletion of the prospective user's data upon denial.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nPlease ensure all new components and routes are consistent with our existing UI/UX standards. Utilize the provided components and infrastructure to maintain uniformity across our application.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n- Vue Documentation: (https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)\r\n- Vue Router Documentation: (https://router.vuejs.org/)\r\n- Adonis JS ORM Documentation: https://v5-docs.adonisjs.com/guides/database/migrations\r\n- Lucid ORM Documentation: (https://v5-docs.adonisjs.com/guides/models/introduction)\r\n\r\nPlease update this issue with any progress, including any blockers or additional support needed. Our aim is to ensure a smooth integration process for new users while maintaining the security and integrity of our user management system.\r\n",

These include handlers like onClick, onKeyDown, onMouseUp, and more. When these handlers are added to an HTML element, they make the element respond to the specified user interaction.\r\n\r\nWhen non-interactive elements have interactive handlers, it can lead to several problems:\r\n\r\n- Unexpected behavior: Non-interactive elements are not designed to be interactive, so adding interactive handlers can cause unexpected behavior. For example, non-interactive elements do not naturally receive keyboard focus, so keyboard users might not be able to activate the handler.\r\n- Confusing for assistive technologies: Assistive technologies might not announce non-interactive elements with interactive handlers correctly. This can make it difficult for users to understand how to interact with the content.\r\n- Violation of HTML standards: Using interactive handlers on non-interactive elements can be seen as a misuse of HTML, as it goes against the intended use of these elements.\r\n\r\nBy enforcing that interactive handlers are only used on interactive elements, this rule helps create a more predictable and user-friendly experience for all users, and ensures that web content adheres to accessibility standards and best practices.\r\n\r\n## Project\r\n\r\nFile: documentation-website/src/components/faq.tsx:30\r\nsonar: https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?open=AY56G_ONMEQ4F21StfOr&id=Idrinth_api-bench\r\n",

A good set of colors to have would be:\r\n\r\n- a primary color, a more muted tint/shade, and a more intense tint/shade\r\n- a secondary color, a muted version, and an intense version\r\n- an accent color, a muted version, and an intense version\r\n- \"white\" (a very light color for light-mode background and dark-mode text)\r\n- \"black\" (a very dark color for light-mode text and dark-mode background\r\n\r\n- [x] 3. Decide which colors should be used for backgrounds, headers, normal text, links, etc.\r\n- [x] 4.

Change the CSS properties used in `blog/static/colors.css` and `blog/static/style.css` to use your new colors. Rename them to describe either what colors they are or what elements they should be used for.\r\n- [x] 7. Update this issue and ask someone to review it.\r\n\r\nAcceptance criteria:\r\n\r\n- [x] Headers will have a >=3:1 contrast ratio with any background on which they'll appear.\r\n- [x] Normal text will have a >=4.5:1 contrast ratio with any background on which it will appear.\r\n- [x] UI components like buttons will have a >=3:1 contrast ratio with any background on which they will appear.\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\n\r\n- We want to comply with WCAG 2.1 level AA (an accessibility standard).

[Read more on Mozilla Developer Docs ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen a form error is present, there should be an auditory message for screen reader users to know that there was an error.\r\n\r\nYou can either do this by:\r\nA) When the page reloads, set keyboard focus on the error message so it is read out. OR\r\nB) Add an [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live) region on the status message and trigger it **after** the page loads.\r\n\r\nYou may also consider changing this form to submit with ajax so screen reader users are not sent to the top of the page as happens with a refresh and the existing alert is announced.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe error is not announced by the screen reader.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Turn on a screen reader such as VoiceOver or NVDA.\r\n2. Go to the Lost Password page (/my-account/lost-password).\r\n3. Do not fill in the username or email address field, but submit the form.\r\n4. Listen as the page reloads and observe there's no announcement about the error.\n\n### WordPress Environment\n\nN/A\n\n### Isolating the problem\n\n- [X] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\n- [X] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/products/storefront/).\n- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.",

Open a video inside of a playlist and hit the Shuffle, Loop, Reverse, or Pause button. \r\n\r\n- See that color is the only thing indicating whether the control is active or not. This makes color the only way to distinguish between these states of activity, thus introducing the inaccessibility anti-pattern of [color dependence](https://guides.18f.gov/accessibility/color/).\r\n- See that `aria-pressed` is not set to true.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20240412_190412](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/assets/84899178/0e529c9a-5a28-43e3-bc22-041c6fa87a01)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Add a separate visual indication to the control when it is active and/or inactive. Example from YT: the icon's font-weight increases.\r\n- Add `aria-pressed: true` when a toggle is active.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20240412_191818](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/assets/84899178/645c2948-032d-4157-a698-171f22e2f176)\r\n\r\n### Issue Labels\r\n\r\naccessibility issue, usability issue\r\n\r\n### FreeTube Version\r\n\r\nv0.20.0\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nOpenSUSE TW\r\n\r\n### Installation Method\r\n\r\n.zip\r\n\r\n### Primary API used\r\n\r\nLocal API\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working FreeTube Version (If Any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Nightly Build\r\n\r\n- [X] I have encountered this bug in the latest [nightly build](https://docs.freetubeapp.io/development/nightly-builds).",

Currently the embedded SVG icon is part of the accessibility tree and behaves like an image without alt text. It would be reported as an image by a screen reader or other assistive technology, but would not have an accessible name.\r\n\r\nIf an image is decorative, you would leave the alt attribute empty. For decorative SVG icons, the best practice is to remove them from the accessibility tree with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see these two articles:\r\n- [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html#svgs-that-are-decorative)\r\n- [Accessible Icon Buttons](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-icon-buttons/#icon-sitting-next-to-text)",

Indeed those tasks have a `#19647e` tile color while the status & operator name are displayed in `--chakra-colors-gray-500` (aka `#718096`) on top of it, which makes the text unreadable. You can see a screenshot below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"239\" alt=\"Current situation\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/69579602/8497faa7-9a61-4e59-a0ff-576844cfe67f\">\r\n\r\nI can submit a PR for it if needed but I'm unsure if there's a chart regarding which color to give to what type of operator etc. so please tell me. My idea would be to use same tint but lighter color like `#4db7db` which is more readable (see below) but not perfect for accessibility:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"239\" alt=\"Suggested new color\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/69579602/e2fa562b-668f-4756-9ef0-421d5da3280e\">\r\n\n\n### Use case/motivation\n\nThe current color makes monitoring and debugging very annoying as it's unreadable. It is also a big issue regarding accessibility as color-blind people may not be able to guess the status name by the status color. As an argument, it was red flagged by Chrome Lighthouse when I ran a test on the webpage.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",

We end up with different font- and icon sizes on the screen.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I want the popup menu to stay the same size no matter the zoom level to offer a consistent experience.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, we would also need to keep the context pad from scaling, as it serves the same purpose as the popup menu. Also, we do use both to achieve similar UI to the user, e.g. for the color changer:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/assets/21984219/bc11c888-a111-4dfc-b6b9-afb3ca6e8ce2)\r\n\r\nLooking at other tools like miro, the context is also uses window scale instead of canvas scale and stays the same size no matter how far in or out you zoomed.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nLet's make \"no zoom\" the new default. We can keep the zoom configuration for applications that need it, but require them to enable the feature using the scale config.\r\n\r\n## Additional Info\r\n\r\nDiscovered during https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/pull/878\r\n@marstamm will add this as a topic in the next HOC.",

Even though it follows accessibility standards (>4.5) the perceived readability is low and we should increase the contrast ratio.\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

While there is visual outline structure to blocks, which makes blocks/subblocks distinct, there is no such structure for my screen reader to use. Given something like the following:\r\n\r\n- a1\r\n- a2\r\n  - a3\r\n  - a4\r\n    - a5\r\n    - a6\r\n- a7\r\n\r\nThe screen reader reads blocks a1 to a7 in order, without informing me about the indentation of any block. For me, this makes Logseq mostly unusable for its principle job as an outliner.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce the Bug\r\n\r\n1. Open Logseq (either the web interface or the desktop app) using JAWS/NVDA/your screen reader of choice\r\n2. Create the following structure:\r\n\r\n- outdented block\r\n  - Indented block\r\n- Another outdented block\r\n\r\n3. Read through the page with the typical screen reader navigation keys\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe screen reader has structure which it can use to (1) announce the relative indentation of blocks, and (2) let me navigate through the structure with the keys that the screen reader assigns for me.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Desktop or Mobile Platform Information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nIdeally, the easiest way to solve this would be to make each block a `<li>...</li>`, and allow the structure to be represented as nested `<ul>...</ul>`s. Using semantic HTML like this is all that is required-screen readers can then use that information to offer rich speech and navigation facilities. I'm not sure how that would play with the CSS, though, so further work might be required there?\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to use ARIA to annotate specific blocks with list information, and that would probably play better with the CSS, but ideally we only do that if doing lists in HTML isn't feasible.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to do a PR, as long as we end up using nested lists for this, and as long as someone can verify that my code doesn't break visual structure. I've made small accessibility tweaks to my local Logseq codebase, so adding this shouldn't be too much work (hopefully).\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit a PR? If you know how to fix the bug.\r\n\r\n- [X] I'm willing to submit a PR (Thank you!)",

Go to a table in your table editor (supabase.com)\r\n2. Click on \"add RLS policy\"\r\n3. click on \"Create policy\"\r\n4. on the top of the SQL edit box, click on the \"open SQL editor\" button\r\n5. ask the IA to write some query\r\n6. see the UI\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/113150193/cf4d2679-6c8b-475d-b99c-8984a520bd32)\r\nthe text inside the input box has low contrast, it should be more bright.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/113150193/38aff11d-245e-4f24-8518-e412bf75c223)\r\nthe keymap \"CTRL\" has low contrast, it's hard to see it\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/113150193/4a4d19c8-a350-4919-841d-cfa1e3638662)\r\nthe keymap \"ESC\" in the button \"discard\" is almost invisible. increase contrast.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/113150193/45c4690e-d0ef-4417-b187-86a248fcec10)\r\nsome of the \"git difference\" indicators in each line difficult to read the text.\r\nthe top text on the right query editor has low contrast, it should be incremented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\n- OS: [e.g. macOS, Windows]\r\n- Browser (if applies) [e.g. chrome, safari]\r\n- Version of supabase-js: [e.g. 6.0.2]\r\n- Version of Node.js: [e.g. 10.10.0]\r\n\r\nsome of the issues are easy to fix with CSS, but the SQL text editor is more difficult since I guess supabase is using an integration of vs code in some way (I don't know), but I guess it could be fixed by editing the theme.\r\n\r\nhope it helps!",

I don't think submitting the form is an expected behavior given that the button seems to be an accessibility implementation detail. \r\n\r\n### \ud83e\udd14 Expected Behavior?\r\n\r\nProbably nothing should happen when that button is activated. When a FileTrigger is present, maybe the click event should be passed to the FileTrigger? The HTML file input acts as both a drag and drop area and the file trigger and both enter/space open the file menu rather than submit the form.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude2f Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe DropZone focus trap button can submit the form (usually by accident).\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc81 Possible Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `type=\"button\"` to the instance of `<button>` linked above.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd26 Context\r\n\r\nWhile trying to use DropZone within a form, we noticed unintentional early submits from keyboard users activating the DropZone button rather than the FileTrigger.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/heuristic-joji-c8gv78\r\n\r\nIn the codesandbox, move the keyboard focus to the DropZone and press enter or space.

Please describe\r\n\r\nThe current footer of our store feels incomplete and minimally functional, which might affect user engagement and accessibility.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI propose a redesign of the footer to make it more informative and user-friendly. \r\n\r\n**Use Case and Benefits**\r\n\r\n- Use Case: Customers often scroll to the footer to find contact information, or follow social media links.\r\n- Benefits:  A visually appealing footer contributes to the overall aesthetic of the site, making the user experience more pleasant\r\n\r\n**Potential Challenges**\r\n\r\nThe challenge will involve designing a footer that is not only functional but also fits well with the existing website layout without being too intrusive or slowing down the page load times. Responsive design considerations must be made to ensure the footer looks good on all devices.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Implementation**\r\n\r\nThe new footer could be designed using a flexible grid layout to accommodate different elements effectively. As example, here is an idea of a possible footer:\r\n\r\n![footer](https://github.com/blablageeks/open-shop/assets/31835100/88bf98a4-229a-4433-b55d-30867e9999f9)\r\n\r\n### Impact on Existing Features\r\n\r\nthe redesign should not negatively impact existing features but must be tested extensively to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the rest of the site sections.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively, keeping the footer simple with only essential community name and the mention notice could be considered, but this might not fully tap into the potential of using the footer as a strategic space for user engagement and navigation aid.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A",
